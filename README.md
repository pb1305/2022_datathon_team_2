## About 

2022 [RLadies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/) & [Data Philly](https://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/) datathon aims to connect and enable data science enthusiasts to learn and collaborate while also making a difference in the broader Philadelphia community. This year, we have partnered with [ElderNet](https://eldernetonline.org/) to explore how different programs for elderly and disabled individuals serve the community. Participants are welcome to use any statistical tool they feel comfortable with (R, Python, SAS, SPSS, etc.), but we will be able to provide most support for questions related to R. Everyone is welcome to participate, and there is no minimum requirement for data science proficiency (but we do require an interest in learning data analysis and data science tools and methods!)

[ElderNet of Lower Merion and Narberth](https://eldernetonline.org/) is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1976 by representatives of community, religious and governmental groups. ElderNet serves adults of all ages, especially frail older or younger disabled persons with low to moderate incomes who reside in Lower Merion or Narberth. ElderNet helps older neighbors remain independent and provides a variety of free, practical services so they have access to healthcare, food security, and an improved quality of life. ElderNet also provides information to individuals who need assistance with housing, nursing care, or other necessities.

## Structure

### Kickoff Event (Virtual), February 16, 2022, 6-8pm: 

- Introductions, problem background and Q&A with partner; logistics, data overview, and breakout rooms by teams
- See meeting materials for more info: [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/282561855/), [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KIho-PZE9CqAqW8Xr2gXCoNZnkgSXM4xOWbKnXjFN1c/edit?usp=sharing) and Recording (LINK TO FOLLOW)

Afer the kickoff event, teams will work together using Slack, GitHub, and any other online platform of their choosing (zoom, google meet, etc.). Datathon organizers can set up zoom meetings for teams by request (just contact us on Slack!). Questions to ElderNet should be added to an ongoing [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17vAQniQK6KEQsS2pSP564QzXHEA6kIgHz6mgf5fXHqs/edit?usp=sharing), which ElderNet will check regularly and answer asynchronously. Datathon organizers will be available on Slack to answer any other questions. While we recommend weekly meetings for teams, teams have the flexibility to set up their workflow as they see fit. The following week-by-week approach is recommended: 

### Week-by-week outline (recommended):

- Wednesday, 2/16/2022: Set up a plan of action with your team members during the kickoff event
- Week of 2/21/2022: Run descriptives to get to know the datasets and use RMarkdown/Jupyter to document observations (this also gets you started on the report early!)
- Week of 2/28/2022: Wrap up data cleaning; explore data in more depth, documenting process and observations; teams decide on the story to tell through findings
- Week of 3/7/2022: Run analyses towards data story and write up the conclusions and observations as you go along; for data viz, develop a dashboard with your story in mind
- Week of 3/14/2022: Draft a combined RMarkdown/Jupyter report that brings together your teamâ€™s most interesting findings and tells your data story; refine your analyses/dashboard 
- Week of 3/21/2022: Polish your report/dashboard, create slide deck for presentation
- Wednesday, 3/30/2022: Present your findings to ElderNet & the other groups
    
### Conclusion Event (Virtual), March 30, 6-8pm: 

- Teams will present their results and discuss their experiences. Each team will have the freedom to choose one or more group members to present the team's results, or to request that a datathon lead presents the team's results if no group members are available to present. The latter option requires some advance coordination. Final report submissions should be done by the end of this week as well.

## Deliverables 

Each team is asked to create 2 deliverables by the conclusion meetup:

1. A conclusion presentation (~20 minutes) summarizing the most important findings, including team objectives, main findings, challenges and future directions

## Teams

- **Team 1: ElderNet's impact in the community**
    - How has ElderNet helped clients remain in their home longer?
    - How well is ElderNet connecting participants to the public benefits they need? (consider number of interactions, type of benefits/assistance provided, duration between `ElderNet enrollment` and first ride or first pantry interaction)
    - How do the counties served by ElderNet compare to similar counties where services like ElderNet are not available? (e.g. combine with Census data)

- **Team 2: Decision-making insights dashboard**
    - Develop an interactive dashboard that will help ElderNet leadership make better informed decisions. Consider volume of work, population served, assistance provided, donations received, and volunteer time, etc.)
    
- **Team 3: Growth Opportunities and Fun Facts**
    - Are there areas of need that ElderNet should focus on in the future? (e.g. you can use Census data to provide an in-depth picture by county/zip code of the population, and their likely needs)
    - Explore ElderNet's growth with regard to number of clients, donors/donation amount, etc.
    - Any other analyses you think would be interesting to do/helpful to ElderNet to better understand their data
